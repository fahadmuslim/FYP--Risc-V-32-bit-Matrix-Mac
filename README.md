Hardware-Based Acceleration of Matrix MAC on an FPGA

## Project Description

This project aims to develop a hardware-based acceleration solution for matrix multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations. We are designing a RISC-V-based processor with a custom instruction set architecture (ISA) optimized for efficient matrix MAC computations. By incorporating dedicated hardware accelerators and advanced optimization techniques, our goal is to enhance the performance and power efficiency of matrix operations, particularly in the context of machine learning and scientific computing applications.
